My name is Matthew Hamilton. Since 2015, I have worked for a holographic start-up [Avalon Holographics](https://www.avalonholographics.com/). 
I also run a small softwware company on the side called [Birch Scientific](http://www.birchscientific.com/).
Before that I worked for [GRI Simulations](https://www.grisim.com/), a simulation and visualization company.
I completed my [PhD](https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/4507a7c6-dffc-459e-b217-bc12d05e4fe3) in Computing Science at the University of Alberta in 2013 working in the [Advance Man-Machine Interfaces Lab] (https://spaces.facsci.ualberta.ca/ammi/).
Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate at Memorial University in Pure Mathematics and Computer Science.
