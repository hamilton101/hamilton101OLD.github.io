# Multiscale visualization

Physical phenomenon of interest span vast ranges of spatiotemporal scales. This range of scales adds challenging complexity in imaging, simulation and visualization of phenomenon of interest. 
In order to manage the "tyranny of scales", useful ways of filtering complex data are required. Below we show how filtering can be used to allow for a real-time, interactive tool for
exploring visualization of a complex protein folder simulaton dataset with a user-adjsutable scale filtering parameter:

A DNA molecule made up of atomic units reconstructed/filtered at different scales. Features of interest at larger scales appear to be more visually salient when smaller scale information
has beena attenuated by the filtering:
